Want to learn:
- custom google fonts X
- CSS grid 
- when to use const versus let ** ANYTIME you don't have to use let, use const
- toggle-able classes in CSS X
- how to incorporate graphic design elements

What I learned/practiced:
- css grid
- differences btwn a(nav), button(onclick), input(form), and div(animation, etc.) tags for creating "buttons"
- span vs div (inline vs block)
- ANYTIME you don't have to use let, use const
- lots of backend variable and function practice!


Tips:
- body {} automatically has margin:8px, remember to set to 0
- Always use the proper HTML tags, like <h1>h1</h1> & <h6>h6</h6> for headings and <p>p for paragraphs.</p>
- cursor: pointer; on element
- body {font-size: 100%;}
- keep in mind what should be a global vs. local variable

To do in future:
- when displaying exponentially large numbers, fix style to not overflow from display
